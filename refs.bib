abstract = {This pedagogical review presents the proof of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in the form ofan efficient classical algorithm for compiling an arbitrary single-qubit gate into a sequenceof gates from a fixed and finite set. The algorithm can be used, for example, to compileShor's algorithm, which uses rotations of π/2k, into an efficient fault-tolerant form usingonly Hadamard, controlled-not, and π/8 gates. The algorithm runs in O(log2.71(1/ε))time, and produces as output a sequence of O(log3.97(1/ε)) quantum gates which isguaranteed to approximate the desired quantum gate to an accuracy within ε &gt; 0. Wealso explain how the algorithm can be generalized to apply to multi-qubit gates and togates from SU(d).},

abstract = {Semidefinite programs (SDPs) have been used in many recent approximation algorithms. We develop a general primal-dual approach to solve SDPs using a generalization of the well-known multiplicative weights update rule to symmetric matrices. For a number of problems, such as Sparsest Cut and Balanced Separator in undirected and directed weighted graphs, Min UnCut and Min 2CNF Deletion, this yields combinatorial approximation algorithms that are significantly more efficient than interior point methods. The design of our primal-dual algorithms is guided by a robust analysis of rounding algorithms used to obtain integer solutions from fractional ones. Our ideas have proved useful in quantum computing, especially the recent result of Jain et al. [2011] that QIP = PSPACE.},

abstract = {In the first part of the paper we consider the problem of dynamically apportioning resources among a set of options in a worst-case on-line framework. The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone–Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line.}
