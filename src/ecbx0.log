computing got too large, so I'm afraid your answers will be
somewhat askew. You'll probably have to adopt different
tactics next time. But I shall try to carry on anyway.

with that big value; but it might be dangerous.

I'm afraid I don't know how to apply that operation to that
combination of types. Continue, and I'll return the second
argument (see above) as the result of the operation.

The equation I just read contradicts what was said before.
But don't worry; continue and I'll just ignore it.

somewhat askew. You'll probably have to adopt different
tactics next time. But I shall try to carry on anyway.
